    Kung Fu Panda 2 is a 2011 American computer-animated action comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the sequel to Kung Fu Panda (2008) and the second installment in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. Directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (in her feature directorial debut), the film stars Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, David Cross, James Hong, and Jackie Chan reprising their character roles from the first film, with Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh, Danny McBride, Dennis Haysbert, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Victor Garber voicing new characters. In the film, Po and his allies (Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, Mantis) travel to Gongmen City to stop a villainous peacock from conquering China, while also rediscovering Po's forgotten past.
