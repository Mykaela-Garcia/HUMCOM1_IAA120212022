<h1>J.K. Rowling</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>
        Joanne Rowling, also known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She wrote a seven-volume children's fantasy series, Harry Potter, published from 1997 to 2007. The series has been enormously successful: it has sold over 500 million copies, been translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, as Robert Galbraith. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Films</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        In 1999, Warner Bros. purchased film rights to the first two Harry Potter novels for a reported $1 million. Rowling accepted the offer with the provision that the studio only produce Harry Potter films based on books she authored, while retaining the right to final script approval, and some control over merchandising. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, an adaptation of the first Harry Potter book, was released in November 2001. Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, with Rowling's assistance, ensuring that his scripts kept to the plots of the novels. The film series concluded with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which was adapted in two parts; part one was released on 19 November 2010, and part two followed on 15 July 2011.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Later Harry Potter Works</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Pottermore, a website with information and stories about characters in the Harry Potter universe, launched in 2011. On its release, Pottermore was rooted in the Harry Potter novels, tracing the series's story in an interactive format. Its brand was associated with Rowling: she introduced the site in a video as a shared media environment to which she and Harry Potter fans would contribute. The site was substantially revised in 2015 to resemble an encyclopedia of Harry Potter. Beyond encyclopedia content, the post-2015 Pottermore included promotions for Warner Bros. films including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Awards and Honours</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Rowling has won numerous accolades for the Harry Potter series for general literature, children's literature and speculative fiction. In 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban was nominated for the Whitbread Book of the Year where it competed against a book by a Nobel prize laureate. The award body gave it the children's prize instead (worth half the cash amount); some scholars view this as exposing a literary prejudice against children's books. The series has won multiple British Book Awards, beginning with the Children's Book of the Year for Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, followed by a shift to the more general Book of the Year for Half-Blood Prince. It received speculative fiction awards such as the Hugo Award for Best Novel for Goblet of Fire.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        In early February 2013, during its quarterly financial call to investors, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed that the next Assassin's Creed game, due for release some time before April 2014, would feature a new hero, time period, and development team. On February 28, 2013, Ubisoft posted their first promotional picture and cover for their next Assassin's Creed game, following leaked marketing material days before. It announced the title of the game as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and featured an unnamed character holding a flintlock and a sword with a black flag in the background containing the Assassin's symbol with a skull.
